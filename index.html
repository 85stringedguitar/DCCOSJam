        Hopefully, not anymore! But that was the situation for many of us when,
        on August 30, 2020, we went live with these JamKazam help pages and
        a now-retired directory. Although most of us are meeting in person again, for many,
        JamKazam remains a useful modality that enables us to rehearse at a
        distance when we need or want to, to save gas or time, or to stay
        connected with the online community that formed during the pandemic. So…
        we will not be retiring these pages at this time. (Rumor is that a big
        JamKazam update is coming, and we’ll see if we’ll still be relevant
        then.)

      <h2>Directory</h2>

        During the pandemic we partnered with Associated Chamber Music Players
        (ACMP) to support the online playing community, and we made a successful
        case for building a robust capability to find online players. In
        September 2022, ACMP introduced a wonderful new website that makes it
        extremely easy both to indicate which online services you use, and to
        find people to play with. There is no cost to join ACMP, so if you
        haven’t already done it, make yourself a profile and get listed in their
        <a href="https://acmp.net/directory/?mode=players" target="_blank"
          ><strong>Players Directory</strong></a
        >. To access the
        <strong>search by online playing service</strong> capability, toggle
        Advanced Search to <strong>on</strong>. An added benefit of ACMP
        membership is access to a discounted JamKazam gold plan. Once you are
        logged into the ACMP site, you can place your order for a subscription
        <a href="https://acmp.net/benefit/jamkazam/" target="_blank"
          ><strong>here</strong>.

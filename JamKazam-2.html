      <h1>Getting started with JamKazam</h1>
      <p>
        üåü <strong>New</strong> üåü 10/20/20 - Updated to accord with major
        changes in September 2020 release.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >***Note: JamKazam is a work in progress, with new releases appearing
          fairly often. Until recently, official JamKazam documentation was not
          available, so at various points people have written guides to using
          it. You will find links to some of these and
          <a href="JamKazam-6">other useful resources</a> in that section. With
          the September 2020 update, JamKazam has built a lot more documentation
          into the application. Clicking on the yellow question marks and other
          embedded links now brings up useful information. Despite these
          improvements, we've decided, at least for the moment, to continue to
          put enough here to get you started. As you grow more sophisticated in
          your usage of JamKazam, you will find discussions elsewhere of topics
          we do not cover. For the present exposition, we initially leaned
          heavily on the document developed by Josh Larios. Any mistakes are, of
          course, our fault. ***

      </p>

      <p>
        For these next instructions, and pretty much everything in these help
        pages, you will be using the JamKazam application,
        <em>not the JamKazam website</em>. When you're ready, with everything
        hooked up and the app launched, create a profile for the gear you‚Äôll be
        using. This process will also ensure that your gear works. Start by
        selecting the "account" box at the bottom right of the home screen:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/new account.png"
          alt="account"
          width="212"
          height="132"
          style="max-width: 212px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        You‚Äôll see some information about you. Click the update button on the
        audio gear line:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/new my account info.png"
          alt="account info"
          width="505"
          height="112"
        />
      </p>
      <p>You should see a screen like this:</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/new audio profile update.png"
          alt="audio profile update"
          width="659"
          height="217"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on Add New Gear. JamKazam will now lead you through a series of
        steps. Step 1 is a suggestion that you familiarize yourself with the
        platform. If you‚Äôve followed our advice, you‚Äôve already done that and
        you can click on to Step 2. You should now see a screen with a pull-down
        menu that will allow you to choose your input and output. Go ahead and
        do that. For example, say you've got a USB audio device called ‚ÄúForte‚Äù
        that you‚Äôll be using:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/select audio input.png"
          alt="audio input"
          width="382"
          height="214"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you‚Äôve selected input and output devices, it should start running
        some tests. If the tests fail, it won‚Äôt let you continue. Hopefully
        it‚Äôll tell you what went wrong. If it lets you, click ‚ÄúNext."
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/latency test.png"
          alt="latency test"
          width="387"
          height="243"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it‚Äôll ask you what you want to use for voice chat. Most likely, if
        you are a classical musician, you have a microphone that is picking up
        your acoustic instrument that‚Äôll also pick up your voice, and you can
        use that. But perhaps the mike you are using for your piano is far away
        from your face and you'd like to set up a separate chat microphone.
        We'll choose a different input for the instrument track and use Forte
        for the chat microphone instead:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/voice chat.png"
          alt="chat microphone"
          width="387"
          height="236"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking Next from here brings you to Step 5. Follow the instructions on
        the screen to check your audio settings. Don't skip this step--make sure
        you really can hear the tone through your headphones. If you can't,
        check that you've turned any direct monitoring options off and/or that
        your headphones work. Click Next and then "Close" to reveal the audio
        profiles page. Your new configuration should be listed and shown as
        active:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/audio profiles.png"
          alt="audio profiles"
          width="405"
          height="119"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it‚Äôs time to try entering a session. Click the house icon at the top
        right to go back to the home screen. Select the create session box at
        the top left of the home screen:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/create session.png"
          alt="create session"
          width="287"
          height="270"
          style="max-width: 287px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>Then click on the first choice, ‚ÄúQuick Start Private‚Äù:</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/new quick start sessions.png"
          alt="quick start private session"
          width="400"
          height="209"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few seconds, you should see a screen with your name and some
        icons appear. Well done! You are in your first JamKazan session. Try
        playing something. You should be able to hear yourself through your
        headphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="./images/new inside a session with chat.png"
          alt="in session"
          width="508"
          height="239"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can‚Äôt hear yourself in a quick start solo session, you‚Äôre not
        going to be able to hear yourself in any other kind of session, so get
        that fixed first. On a newer Mac, it may be a problem with audio
        permissions. Open the System Preferences, go to Security &amp; Privacy,
        and click the Privacy tab. In the list of permissions on the left, click
        Microphone. JamKazam should show up in the list on the right, and it
        should be checked, like so:<br />
        <img
          src="./images/audio permissions.png"
          alt="audio permissions"
          width="390"
          height="343"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue that might arise on a Mac is the need to explicitly choose
        your JamKazam input and output sources. Normally this is not necessary,
        but if, when you try to do the above gear configuration, your target
        devices do not appear in the menu, that‚Äôs likely the problem. The
        <strong>Audio MIDI setup</strong> utility found in Applications &gt;
        Utilities should list all the input and output devices choices available
        to you. Once you select and/or enable them there, they will be available
        to choose in the Sound preferences pane and JamKazam.
